What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

There's just many trials and errors. For example, not putting printed class in {} would print an unreadable message, not putting () after functions would led to an error etc. And also it's just getting into the habit of printing `self` in front of all the other codes because it is object-oriented. An advice I would give is to ask the professor or a TA before spending too much time on the assignment because you might be heading an entirely different way.
